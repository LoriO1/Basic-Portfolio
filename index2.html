                <p>Iâ€™ve always been extremely creative. In high school, my artwork placed 2nd and 3rd, respectively, in two Illinois statewide competitions. I love branding, logo design, organizing and streamlining business processes, and attention to details. My background includes strong skills in graphic design for large-format and specialty print, logo designs, and my art portfolio even includes <a href="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=376siagaz8g" id="interior" target="blank" alt="EMD Performance Materials - San Diego">commercial interior design</a>. 
                <p>I've studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, College of DuPage, and UCSD. In 2018, I earned my DMCP (Document Management Certified Professional), and am currently working towards a PMP (Project Management Professional) certification as well as a certificate from UCSD focusing in software and web app development.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have advanced, Specialist-level skills level in SharePoint Online. The project I'm currently managing at work involves:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building a Communications site in SharePoint to act as the intranet for the San Diego location of my organization</li>
                        <li>Planning and building the SharePoint site collections to act as the platform for housing the QMS documents and streamlining business processes</li>
                        <li>Building Workflows, Flows, and other features</li>
                        <li>Reorganizing the entire QMS document structure</li>
                        <li>Ensuring document content is compliant with multiple Standards</li>
                        <li>Migrating the entire collection of QMS documents onto the SharePoint</li>
                        <li>Training all staff at the San Diego location on the new system</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, my career goal is to combine my creative, business, technical, and project management skills into a comprehensive, well-rounded package that allows me to work seamlessly with any team, and brings endless value to those teams through the versatility of skills I offer.</p>
