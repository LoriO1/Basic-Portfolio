                Iâ€™ve always been extremely creative. In high school, my artwork placed
                2nd and 3rd, respectively, in two Illinois statewide competitions. I
                love branding, logo design, and organizing and streamlining business
                processes. My background includes strong
                skills in graphic design for large-format and specialty print, logo
                designs, and my art portfolio even includes

                        alt="EMD Performance Materials - San Diego">commercial interior design</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, College of
                DuPage, and UCSD. In 2018, I earned my DMCP (Document Management
                Certified Professional), and am currently working towards a PMP
                (Project Management Professional) certification as well as a
                certificate from UCSD focusing in software and web app development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, my career goal is to combine my creative, business,
                technical, and project management skills into a comprehensive,
                well-rounded package that allows me to work seamlessly with any team.
